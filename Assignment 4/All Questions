Lab assignment day 4

1. Implementation of method overloading with respect to parameter number, parameter data type.
2. Write a java program to implement of constructor overloading.
3. Implementation of this keyword to invoke current class method.
4. Implementation of this keyword to invoke current class constructor.
5. Implementation of this keyword to pass as an argument in the method.
6. Implementation of this keyword to pass as argument in the constructor call.
7. Implement
â€¢ this keyword can be used to return current class instance.
8. Prove that this keyword refers to the current class instance variable.
9. Implementation of this keyword as local variable suppressor.
10. Create a general class ThreeDObject and derive the classes Box, Cube, 
    Cylinder and Cone from it. The class ThreeDObject has methods wholeSurfaceArea ( ) 
    and volume ( ). Override these two methods in each of the derived classes 
    to calculate the volume and whole surface area of each type of three-dimensional objects.
    The dimensions of the objects are to be taken from the users and passed through 
    the respective constructors of each derived class. Write a main method to test these classes.
